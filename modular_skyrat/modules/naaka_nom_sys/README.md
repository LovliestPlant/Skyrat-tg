it's scrunkle gaming time

# PLAN OF ATTACK
1. fucking obliterate the chomp sprites cuz they bad, make homebrew ones following the logarithmic scale used on NuKita base
2. item that fits in one of the lewd slots, always displays belly size, recolor with GAGS, alt-click to change between sprite sizes
3. while worn randomly play sounds primarily from the creaking sound section, frequency increased by size selection, intermittently include minor gurgles for variety
4A. click on someone with the item in-hand to "nom" them, setting their loc to the item & forcing them to safe settings similar to borgo if possible (this may need more basecode edits, agony)
4B. ALT: item stores a reference to that person but sets their loc to their host, letting our existing code kick in to allow safety
5. if item is dropped or used inhand again with someone nommed, release them
